Hello all! 

I used to work for iBox Printers up until the point it closed. And now that it has closed, I wish to release the source code to the community to help improve the printer and make the community happier with their product. I do appologiese to those who did not recieve a printer and had a hard time with the company. I hope that this will help make you happier. With that being said here is what these folder contain. 

The folder labled "Nano ibox folder" is the ibox directory of the printer. This one contains the source code as well as the complied file as up to date since I was let go from the company. There are also some print packages that were left in there since this is a direct copy of my personal printer I used to develop with for the company. The main file that runs the printer is called "iBoxPrintManager.py" and the web GUI file is called "iBoxWebGUI.js". 

In the folder labled "PCB Files" there are the Eagle PCB layout files for the printer's PCB. There are also pick and place files in there which we used for the surface mount componentes. Also for those of you that used Altium, there is a folder which has the board which was converted from Eagle. 

And finally, I have made a direct image dump from my personal development printer. Here is the link to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6_silB01EPpQ0lyNnV3Z2VMd0U/view?usp=sharing . This should be ok to flash driectly to your printer and might fix any isses that is software related. This came from an 8 GB Micro SD card so you will need to use at least an 8 GB card or higher. 

I hope that this helps the community! 

Sincerely,
Fox
